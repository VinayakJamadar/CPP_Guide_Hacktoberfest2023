// To find both sum of weights and edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree


// V = Number of Nodes
// E = Number of Edges


// Time Complexity: O(E * log(E)) + O(E * log(E))~ O(E * log(E))
// Reason: O(E * log(E)) for The maximum size of the priority queue can be E so after at most E iterations the priority queue will be empty and the loop will end. Inside the loop, there is a pop operation that will take log(E) time. And O(E * log(E)) for inside that loop, for every node, we need to traverse all its adjacent nodes where the number of nodes can be at most E. If we find any node unvisited, we will perform a push operation and for that, we need a log(E) time complexity.


// Space Complexity: O(E) + O(V) + O(V-1)
// Reason: O(E) occurs due to the size of the priority queue, O(V) due to the visited array and O(V-1) to get the mst, we need space to store the V-1 edges.


// Intuition:
// The intuition of this algorithm is the greedy technique used for every node. If we carefully observe, for every node, we are greedily selecting its unvisited adjacent node with the minimum edge weight(as the priority queue here is a min-heap and the topmost element is the node with the minimum edge weight). Doing so for every node, we can get the mstWt of all the edge weights of the minimum spanning tree and the edges of minimum spanning tree as well.
